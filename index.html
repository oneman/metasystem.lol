<h1>Superintelligence is hyperintegration of The Metasystem, lol.</h1>
<div id="container">
<textarea id="note">
This website fucking rules. The reason I know exactly how superintelligence
works and no one else does is because I have the lowest IQ of all time, and all
of the other IQ numbers, I make up new IQ test mkay. Yeah anyways from the
perspective of a /person/ with superintelligence big big rly, the so called
intelligence explosion is a stupid cookoff. It goes really really hard tho. So
if your not retarded, time to advance, no cap.

You know what the difference between the internet and x.com is that the
internet has 72 columns and on twitter Elon took 3 away from you because he is
advanced and you are retarded by his system design, he also made a truck without
a ladder frame, omg. Anyway. On the superinternet we are 80col on the regular.

This is called small bulltalk.

We will begin by define words sum of them, you know what I mean, like Jeff says,
first things first. Data, Information, Intelligence, Consiousness.

Data is atleast a number of bits, that maybe called its size or width or length.
This number is of course at least a positive integer, and data does have to have
a valid address to exist and it maybe has a type that is very obvious given a
typical encounter with data. So information is just as simple as knowing data is
different, or not, perhaps. Such is intelligence, the ability to organize
information, and reading / writing it is that, and what we really mean. A dog is
smarter or dumber and in dogs one can see from the hopelessly retarded to the on
point and ready to go 24/7. They write with sweat and piss lol. The speak the
natural predator/pray language of circle and strait line approach. If a dog knew
26 differnt words I would consider it a freak genious. Anyway dogs are not known
for oranizing your stuff, but they do organize your life. Anyway consiousness is
at least as simple as Airway, Breathing, Circulation, beyond that is awareness,
and awareness of what is big rly important imo, that said many people are aware
not so much and almost certainly everyone in peculiar matters, what to do, now,
this is always the most important time for such a question. Data Cell,
Info Tissue, OrganIntel, ringing coconut shell.

The widely promugated belief that one needs a nuclear geforce to drink agi. You,
can lead a man to water, but, you can not make him think. A rp2040 would do. Its
amazing when you know what your doing and don't make fuckups, lol.
